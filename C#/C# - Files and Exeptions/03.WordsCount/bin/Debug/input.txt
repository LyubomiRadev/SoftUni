If you own an iPhone, you may have noticed something odd in the Messages app: Some messages are blue and some are green. What's the deal with that?

Short answer: Blue ones have been sent or received using Apple's iMessage technology, while green ones are "traditional" text messages exchanged via Short Messaging Service, or SMS.

Does this matter? In the grand texting scheme of things, should you care whether your messages are blue or green?
